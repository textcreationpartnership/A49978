            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough my Lot be fallen in a Scribling Contentious Age, which makes many things of weight and ſubſtance ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (which was ready to deter me from wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) yet I find it my Duty, according to my capacity, to detect Falſhoods and Slanders covered with a profeſſion of Truth, of which ſort, the Book of Certificates publiſhed by <hi>John Pennington,</hi> is plentifully ſtored. But 'tis not my intent to make Reply to the particular Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ſaid <hi>Penington</hi> brings againſt <hi>G.

K's words: But the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41023:3"/> of the great diſcovering Day is dawned wherein all ſhall be laid open, and no man ſhal hinder it.</p>
            <p>But to the Certificates my intent is to ſpeak, &amp; chiefly to that ſent from a Monthly Meeting at <hi>Burlington</hi> the 6 t. 6 m. 1694. which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends moſt of the reſt, I ſhall firſt ſhow how it was obtained (as I had it as well from ſome that ſigned it, as from others which refuſed to ſign it) and <hi>next,</hi> I ſhall ſhew how it is ſtuft full of Lyes and Slanders, that the impartial <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee how they ſly to Lyes for a <hi>Refuge,</hi> and to Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for <hi>Revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When News came from <hi>England</hi> that <hi>S.

J. made application firſt to ſome Members of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> Meeting, &amp; obtained a Certificate to relieve her Husband in that diſtreſs, for which I blame her not. Then <hi>J. Wilsford</hi> and <hi>Fr. Devonport,</hi> two of that Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, came to the Meeting at <hi>Burlington,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogate the buſineſs there. And having framed a Certificate, it was read in the Meeting, and ſome readily ſigned it, but ſome others, (more willing to ſee with their own Eyes) made ſome ſcruple; and one or two, it ſeems, queſtioned the truth of what was written about <hi>D.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41023:3"/> Others refuſed wholly to ſet hand to it, and ſhewed their Reaſons, which I could inſert, but for brevity's ſake omit; at laſt it appeared one third of the Meeting did not ſign to it, which look't a little odd to thoſe that had ſigned it; whereupon they reſolved upon this Expedient, <hi>viz.</hi> to write it over again, and for one man to ſign it in the Name of the Meeting, and ſo bring in all thoſe to be guilty of ſigning, that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>[A notable way to force a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity]</hi> and for this purpoſe they made uſe of <hi>James Marſhall,</hi> that it might look with a fairer face, and laid aſide their Clerk (for that time) <hi>becauſe</hi> (as <hi>J.

               </gap>here being printed, and returned hither again, is now come under conſideration; which before they endeavoured to prevent me and others of: For, I having an account, as aforeſaid, went to their next Monthly Meeting for a Copy of the Judgment they had drawn up againſt me, and ſent to <hi>England,</hi> wherein (I told them) I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood I was defamed. They anſwered, <hi>They had not defamed me, nor wrote any untruth of me.</hi> To which I replyed, <hi>If you have not wronged me, I hope you will be the more willing to do me juſtice, in granting me a Copy; I'll pay for the writing of it,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe and many more words paſſed, but at laſt the reſult was [having none of their Miniſters there] <hi>That I could have no anſwer till next Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41023:4"/> I went again next Meeting, but no Copy could I obtain, &amp; <hi>J. Wilsford</hi> gave me an anſwer in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> G. Keith, <hi>und a Company of you have printed and exproſed us ſo ſhamefully to the World, until you condemn that, thou, ſhalt have no Copy by my Conſent.</hi> To which I replyed, <hi>People, behold your Preacher! he preaches, Revenge is his Christian Doctrine, he will not do Justice, becauſe others have done unjuſtly, as he alledges.</hi> With that, two of the Meeting roſe up, and faced me with a fierce Countenance, mixt part with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and part with Scorn, uttering bitter words, and one of them I remember rendered me a <hi>Jeſuite.</hi> And this was all the Juſtice I could obtain from them.</p>
            <p>But the Certificate being printed in <hi>England,</hi> as aforeſaid, and returned to <hi>America</hi> having miſſed the hands of <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> ſo that he could not keep them up from the Perſons concerned, as he did his own Lying Book, called, <hi>The ſtate of the Caſe, &amp;c.</hi>) one of theſe Books of Certificates is come to my hands. And the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I note is, <hi>They alledge</hi> Peter Boſs <hi>makes a great Noiſe with his Queries &amp; Witneſſes to prove them.</hi> To which <hi>I</hi> ſay, The Noiſe was ſo little, before <hi>S. Jenings</hi> arreſted him (&amp; ſo made the Noiſe himſelf that very few of that Meeting heard it much leſs in other parts; and although they reſent it ſo hethens a Crime in <hi>P. Boſs</hi> for querying with S.J. whether thoſe Reports were true, or not, yet we ſee the twelve men of the Jury (thoſe of them his own Brethren) could not find it ſo much as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41023:4"/> a Slander, ſo little was the wrong done by <hi>P. B.</hi> &amp; had it not been for a Law made by a pattern from <hi>New-England</hi> (as <hi>VV. Byles</hi> told me) that makes it finable to ſpeak ſlightingly of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the Jury muſt have cleared <hi>P. Boſs</hi> in the caſe. And then what become<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of this heinous Crime of <hi>murthering a mans Reputation,</hi> as S. J. calls it?</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, They accuſe <hi>P. Boſs of prejudice againſt</hi> S. J. <hi>ever ſince the Meeting gave Judgment againſt him in the caſe of a difference between him and his Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſſ.</hi> As to the Meeting giving Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt P. B. I know to be falſe, being preſent at the Meeting when the thing was debated; but if his Enemies ſince have got a Judgment into the Meeting Book about that difference, be it to them that did it.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, They alledge, <hi>he flattered, perſwaded &amp; queried with People, to make up thoſe bundles of ſtuff,</hi> meaning the Queries. But I believe this is not true, for theſe Reaſons, 1st. <hi>P. Boſs</hi> is known to all that know him, to be no flatterer, but a man plain and blunt, and truly for this reaſon I find my ſelf the more concerned in his Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe I even hated flattery. 2dly, There was no need of his flattering or perſwading; for 'tis known to all the Meetings, and all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, that moſt of thoſe Reports concerning <hi>S. Jenings</hi> were frequent about the Country long before P. B. queried concerning the truth of them.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41023:5"/>
            <p>4ly, They accuſe P. B. of being <hi>rude, wicked and cruel to his Maid-ſervant, becauſe he could not obtain his Will.</hi> This muſt needs be a baſe Slander at leaſt; for, 1ſt, they inſinuate hereby, as if he would have lain with her; which tho' 'twas ſaid, ſhe had reported ſome ſuch thing, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined, news was brought that ſhe deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: And I remember that I then took it as the general ſence of the Meeting, that ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make her Maſter weary of her, to be ſet free, or change her ſervice; a thing very deſirable to moſt that come Servants from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to theſe parts. 2dly, They do not in the leaſt declare wherein he was <hi>rude, wicked &amp; cruel,</hi> as they ought to have done: if <hi>they had been just to him:</hi> They ſay in their <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> Certificate, <hi>That their well-beloved Brother</hi> S J. <hi>was juſt to all men;</hi> Why then are they not juſt to <hi>P. Boſs,</hi> and tell wherein he was <hi>rude, wicked</hi> &amp; <hi>cruel,</hi> and yet <hi>S. Jenings</hi> be juſt to all, though it appears by their own Certificates to clear him, <hi>That he be at a Man Servant till he broke a Cane, and whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> a Maid Servant in her Bed,</hi> ſee p. 32 &amp; 42. I ſay, could this be juſt in <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>He was just to all,</hi> p. 19. and yet he <hi>rude wicked</hi> &amp; <hi>cruel</hi> in <hi>P. Boſs</hi> in beating his Maid, If he did ſo. Reader, pray conſider from what Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>Burlington</hi> Certificate ſpring. Well might a third part of the Meeting refuſe to ſign it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> To render him yet more Odious, if poſſible, they ſay, <hi>If Friends and ſoebr People
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41023:5"/> did but know how reproachful his Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation has been amongſt us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I demand of theſe Enemies of <hi>P. Boſs,</hi> to ſhow wherein his Life and Converſation is ſo reproachful: Is he a Blaſphemer, or Thief, or Knave, or Whoremonger, or Adulterer? Is he a Drunkard, an Extortioner, a Laſcivious or a Proud Perſon? Nay, is he a quarrelſom or ill Neighbour? Next time you print pray be ſo juſt as to tell us, and the world wherein his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is ſo reproachful. But herein you manifeſt <hi>(to the judicious)</hi> your Spirit of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Revenge; for (it ſeems) 'tis ſufficient for you to call a man <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>of a reproachful Life,</hi> and leave it to others to ſhow wherein he is ſo. We are informed, and that by one of your own Friends of the Miniſtry, which came lately out of <hi>England, That</hi> S. J. <hi>when laſt in</hi> England, <hi>made ſearch and enquiry of</hi> P.

Now I would have none to think that I juſtifie <hi>P. Boſs</hi> as a man free from failings, no more than my ſelf, <hi>S.

            <p>The next thing in courſe is about <hi>S. J</hi>'s riding a Horſe-race with <hi>J. Slocum,</hi> and being drunk.

            <p n="2">2dly, They ſay, the third Query is proved a Lye, by a Certificate from the Perſon concerned, and this is my Neighbour <hi>John Antrum,</hi> poor man! I am really ſorry for him, becauſe I think no means no body harm; but to ſay, by what inſtruments or means he was ſo weak to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41023:6"/> drawn by, to deny the truth, and give under his hand, that he had no right to Land there, I ſhall omit at this time; but this <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay, that all or moſt of his Neighbours know, that he then declared, that he had a right to the Land, and that S. J. had ſurveyed it from him, and was in an extream paſſion about it, as ſoon as he heard of it; and I having been the former Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor, he came to me to eaſe himſelf, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I could help him; knowing that <hi>I</hi> knew his right there, he having before told me of his intention about taking it up; but <hi>I</hi> let him know it was out of my power to do any thing in that kind, being out of Office; but he expreſt himſelf in great trouble about it, to me and my Wife, calling the Surveyor <hi>Knave,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I pray God keep me in my right Senſes,</hi> S.

               </hi> is not the Lyar or raiſer of that Report. And if the reſt of the Certificate ſigners have done like my Neighbour <hi>J. Antrum,</hi> they have made a poor hand on't, that after ſo many years feeding upon Sermons from Meeting to Meeting, they at laſt are left ſo hungry to eat their own words; but 'tis no wonder, for their Miniſters have done it alſo, to our certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41023:7"/> And tho' many People know not how to judge, or what to believe, as to theſe things, yet ſurely they are not hid from Almighty God, who will judge righteouſly.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, To the fourth Query, they ſay, <hi>That that Witneſs has for many Tears been a prejudiced Perſon, and declared he hath not had unity with the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſince he came into the Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Obſerve,</hi> They do not in the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein the Evidence I have given may be ſuſpected <hi>[its enough belike they ſay it]</hi> and yet to invalidate my Evidence, they inſinuate to the world in print, That my evidence is not to be taken notice of, becauſe (they ſay) <hi>I am prejudiced;</hi> which is an indirect declaring me <hi>perjured,</hi> becauſe what I there evidenced, was upon my ſolemn Atteſtation before Authority: I am apt to believe that if ſuch a man as <hi>S. J.</hi> had the like thing as this againſt me, he might improve it to my coſt. Does not ſuch actions as theſe render their Meeting; rather Seditious than Religious, thus to meet together to defame men in print, by rendring them unfit to give Evidence, without having matter of Fact to charge them with, muchleſs to prove againſt them?</p>
            <p>But as to the Charge it ſelf, <hi>That I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced,</hi> I do not only hope it is not true, but have and do pray to God that it may not be true, however, I believe my ſelf to be at leaſt as clear as thoſe that affirm it of me. But that <hi>I have declared my ſelf to have no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with the</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41023:7"/> Quakers <hi>ſince I came into the Country,</hi> I know to be a Lye; and in ſhort I'll declare the matter from which <hi>Francis Devenport</hi> draws that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> after I had been four years in the Country, I was at a Monthly Meeting at the Houſe of <hi>John Woolſtone</hi> in <hi>Burlington,</hi> where the Meeting ſeemed in two parties, <hi>W. Peachy, W. Cooper,</hi> and others contending violently againſt <hi>T. Olive, &amp;c.</hi> about the way or method ot exhorting Offenders, &amp; I perfectly remember <hi>T. Olive</hi>'s words were theſe, <hi>If any one have it in their heart from the Lord to go to an Offender, let them go in Gods Name, I am one with them; but for the Meeting to ſend Perſons, I am againſt:</hi> This paſſage I once told <hi>F. Devenport</hi> accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and withal told him, <hi>I was one with</hi> T. O. <hi>in that thing,</hi> and am ſtill of the ſame mind; and this thing <hi>F. Devenport</hi> hath kept, it ſeems, as a Weapon under his ſmooth Coat, near ten Years, to ſtrike me with at this opportunity. So here the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee where their Unity ſtands. Yet as I know no Diſunity I had with the <hi>Quakers</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then, ſo unleſs he can prove <hi>T. Olive,</hi> and thoſe of his ſide then [<hi>viz.</hi> D. W. J. W. and others] no <hi>Quakers,</hi> he cannot ſay but I had Unity them <hi>T. Olive</hi> was a man whom I always loved, and have oft ſaid, That 'twas my belief no man had better kept his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity that came into theſe parts, than <hi>T. O.</hi> had done; and do believe the <hi>Quakers</hi> and he had Unity, notwithſtanding his diſſent from ſome in that point. And therefore <hi>F. Devenport</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41023:8"/> ought not to have let prejudice ſo rule his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as to have witneſſed to a Lye againſt me, upon this Conſequence. But I ſuppoſe <hi>F. D's</hi> word will paſs amongſt more than mine; <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Favour is not to men of Knowledge.</hi> and <hi>F. D.</hi> in one main point declares himſelf true to his Brethren, and therefore muſt needs merit their Unity, <hi>viz.</hi> to hide his Religion under a Buſhel as long as he lives; for he has declared, <hi>That no man ſhall know his Faith, but by his Works;</hi> ſo that the Phariſees of Old may ſtand in competition with him, for they were very juſt men, as to the outward. And thus he can at once kick the Command of the Apoſtle out at the Church Door, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekneſs and fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to <hi>S. Jenings</hi> ſurveving of <hi>R. Matthews</hi> Meadow, his anſwer to it, in Book, called, <hi>ſtate of the caſe, &amp;c.</hi> he has both abuſed me and his own knowledge, in calling what I evidenced, <hi>An idle ſtory,</hi> and yet neither does nor can ſay, the ſtory is not true; and how can that which is true, be idle? for the ſubſtance of what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare upon my Atteſtation, is, <hi>That he ſurveyed that Meadow</hi> (by <hi>Simon Charles</hi>) which is not denyed, but owned by him; in ſhort, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader may early ſee, that <hi>S. Jenings</hi> his Anſwer is onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a crafty Shuffle, even ſuch as a plain honeſt <hi>Quaker</hi> would blaſh at; for I appeal
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41023:8"/> to <hi>S. J.</hi> himſelf, That ſuppoſe the ſurvey of his own Meadow (which lies off from his Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too) were by a miſtake or neglect (in the Recorder) wrong or ſhort recorded, whether he would not count it unjuſt in any that ſhould, take that advantage to take away his Meadow, and thereby ruin his Plantation? Here lies the plain honeſty of the caſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>S. J.</hi> tells <hi>Elias Far,</hi> in his Letter printed with the Certificates, <hi>That all the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was not pretended to be for</hi> Matthews. But I ſay, that's a miſtake, at leaſt, in <hi>S. J.</hi> for there was no more Meadow in that place, but what was ſurveyed and recorded to <hi>Matthews</hi> ſeven years before, which Meadow terminated in a ſmall run of water at the lower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd, where grew ſome Buſhes, and there's a markt Tree or two ſtill to be ſeen, only the Buſhes being burnt root and branch, it ſhews like Meadow further; but the number of Acres would have determined the matter, which was to be 25. our Law allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo to 500 Acres of Land. And this was all that was wanting in the wording the ſurvey, which if that had been, (which it ſeems was by ſome means omitted) the ſurvey had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And therefore if it be printed over never ſo often, <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> is to blame for medling with that Meadow, eſpecially the Owner being abſent, and alſo, inaſmuch as I told him how the caſe ſtood, ſhewed him the Meadow, and alſo a Copy of the Record, when he was about to ſurvey ſaid Meadow, and would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41023:9"/> him from it, as he knows. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the matter.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Burlington</hi> Certificate they tell of a Warrant they have by them, inſinuating as if <hi>J. Skeen</hi> took a courſe at Law with <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>Thou pitiful Whip-jack, I deſpiſe thee;</hi> for that is the thing cited in the Book of the Tryals, pag. 30. which we ſay is falſe; and therefore if they look again, they'll find it their miſtake, nay, a ſly inſinuation to make the VVorld believe that <hi>J. S.</hi> took a courſe at Law <hi>S. J.</hi> for calling him <hi>Ill Names.</hi> VVe grant there was a VVarrant written, but 'twas about their difference concerning the Road to <hi>Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> when they were ſtopt, and there had like to have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Miſchief done; and I heard the VVarrant was never executed; but this was for Actions and Threats, as being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhorſed,</hi> and the like, and it was not <hi>J. Skeen,</hi> but his VVife that complained, being filled with fear of Miſchief, <hi>S. Jenings</hi> having ordered his Son and Servants to ſtop any of <hi>J. Skeens</hi> family coming that way, (and that he himſelf would Unhorſe them, if he met him, <hi>viz. J. S</hi>) and had endeavoured it with Forks, &amp;c. and broke the Bottles of Rum that J. S<hi>'s</hi> Son was carrying to the Reapers: &amp; 'tis to be noted alſo, That ſome of that Meeting were greatly diſſatisfied with <hi>S. Jenings</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in that affair, and reſolved to bring it up in the Meeting, before S. J. removed to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia;</hi> but when the time came, his greatneſs was ſuch as they had not courage to do it. But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41023:9"/> to ſay, their <hi>differences</hi> were quickly ended, is but daubing; for I know that at the next Monthly Meeting after J.S<hi>'s</hi> Death, ſome of S. J<hi>'s</hi> Friends were for putting the matter, on againſt the Widdow, and <hi>I</hi> well remember one in the Meeting anſwered, <hi>Let the Widdow alone, poor Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And whereas they tell of <hi>Henry Beck</hi> and and <hi>J. Smith,</hi> two of the Evidences, getting young VVomen with Child, they ought alſo to have been juſt to theſe men, and let the world know that the Young VVomen were their eſpouſed VVives, that they got with Child: They ſtill are wanting in that excellent Virtue which they ſay <hi>S. Jenings</hi> hath, <hi>To be just to all men;</hi> for they have not been juſt to theſe two, but do, as much as in them lies, to defame well-meaning men, and render them Odious: what though they were overtaken with that Infirmity in their Youth, muſt they therefore be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World in print, as unfit for Evidences, when neither the Law of God nor Man does now condemn them: Surely if <hi>Sam. Jenings be juſt to all men,</hi> as they ſay, needs no ſuch Rubbiſh to defend him.</p>
            <p>Again, they ſay of <hi>J. Bainbridge, That he has been a Drunkard, Fighter, Quarreller, Rude and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41023:10"/> Wicked.</hi> I ſay, I know not but the Man has been ſo; and if he be mended now, does that offend them? pray which of us have not been wicked in one reſpect or other? but it ſeems their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not encourage men in turning from evil, but to render them Odious for the evil they have done: O! what a woful caſe are we in, if God ſhould deal ſo by us! Now <hi>Jo. Bainbridge</hi> denys that ever he called his Mother Jezabel, as they affirm, and ſays, <hi>They cannot prove it, they have belyed him in that; and that his Mother le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Then as what is ſaid of <hi>James Silver,</hi> in the Certificate they declare, that he ſaid, <hi>it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him,</hi> (meaning his Evidence in the Book of the Tryals) <hi>never thinking it ſhould b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> put in print.</hi> Theſe laſt words, <hi>(never thinking it ſhould be put in print)</hi> he owns he ſaid, but ſays, <hi>the other is falſe, he never ſaid it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from him;</hi> for he ſays, <hi>That when they asked him concerning the Truth of what he declared, his anſwer was, Ay, it is all true, and a great deal more; but he did not think when he ſpoke it, that it ſhould have been printed, he was ſorry for that.</hi> And that it is true that he gave them that anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the beſt Friend of mine going by the Houſe of <hi>T.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41023:10"/> not the meaning of the word <hi>extort.</hi> And altho' <hi>Benj. Moore</hi> calls it a great Lye in that <hi>Ja.

Silver</hi> I ſhall relate, <hi>viz.</hi> That on a time when <hi>S. Jenings</hi> was going to <hi>England,</hi> the ſaid B. M. came to his Houſe to make up ſome Accounts with him, or the like, and I ſaw S J. give his old Servant <hi>Benjamin</hi> a very good Leather Garment or two, and 'tis obſervable, that <hi>B. Moore</hi> never after that hath been heard to give his Maſter a hard word, for which I do not blame him; but truly when men ſay and unſay, and ſo make miſchief among their Neighbours, I judge them to blame for that; for <hi>I</hi> take it to be an argument of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I find among the Certificates, That <hi>Benj. More,</hi> jun. charges <hi>Joh. Silver</hi> and <hi>J. Smith</hi> of ſtealing Oats, Powder, Shot, Wool, Eggs, and the like; but I leave them to anſwer for themſelves, that are defamed by it; for I judge it a <hi>Defamation,</hi> if true, becauſe 'tis divulged many years out of time; and tho' it be like the bundles of ſtuff in the reſt of the Certificates, yet <hi>I</hi> ſhould be loath any man ſhould have the like advantage againſt me, as they have againſt the ſaid B. M. if he dare own it eſpecially, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41023:11"/> I had potent partial Friends, but 'tis enough for me to have ſuch Enemies.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope my old Friends will no more judge others for making up bundles of ſtuff, and raking up Dirt; for if they do, they certainly condemn themſelves, as much as ever men did, as he that reads impartially muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. And I deſire they would take notice of this, That I have not uſed that method againſt them <hi>[but what a Defender cannot avoid]</hi> to take up what failings I could againſt them, 'tis not my way, I ſcorn it; I know we are all ſubject to weakneſſes of the fleſh, ſo that I have not been curious (ſince I had the underſtanding of a man) about <hi>Tythe, Mint, Annis</hi> &amp; <hi>Cummin,</hi> or the skirts of Religion, and therefore have been judged by ſome, a looſe Perſon; but 'tis the weightier matters of Religion that I have been and am concerned for, and chiefly the Faith and Merits of our <hi>Lord Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> ſo that when I hear him denyed, ſlighted or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, then a Zeal ariſes in me, and I cannot be ſilent; I mean, that Jeſus for whom the holy Apoſtles and bleſſed Martyrs ſuffered; they did not ſuffer for owning or denying the Light within them (which yet is a Leader unto him) but they ſuffered for profeſſing him that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be Chriſt the Son of God, even that ſame Jeſus whom the <hi>Jews</hi> ſlew and hanged on a Tree (and they could not ſay nor hang the Light there) yea, the very ſame that they ſlew and hanged on a Tree, that

S.?</hi> Had there then been any difference, controverſie or party taking, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by theſe Witneſſes had ſhown themſelves <hi>ſtrong in party</hi> with G. K. and <hi>great Adverſaries to W. Stockdale?</hi> I ſay, Nay, and T. E. has therein uttered a great Falſhood. And I adviſe him next time to have more ground for what he aſſerts than S. J. bare ſay-ſo. But this way I find they take to diſcredit G. K's evidences: its a new trick they have found out (and, <hi>true or falſe,</hi> will be believed by ſome) for nothing was alledged againſt them at the time they gave evidence, but on the contrary <hi>T. Loyd</hi> ſaid then, of one of them, <hi>he might be counted among the Elders, &amp;c.</hi> But he not runing with the ſtream, his Veracity now muſt be queſtioned concerning what he did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence four years ago.</p>
            <p>They having thus endeavoured by Lyes and Falſhoods to diſcredit G. K<hi>'s</hi> evidences, let's hear how S. J. multiplyes the Evidences againſt G. K. <hi>viz. T. Fitzwater</hi> having charged G. K. with <hi>denying the ſufficiency of the Light,</hi> he brings only <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> as an evidence to prove it, but <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> in his <hi>ſtate of the caſe,</hi> p. 3. ſays, <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> brought <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> &amp; <hi>W. Meaning</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41023:12"/> to evidence to the truth of his charge. But as we know <hi>T. F.</hi> never pretended to bring <hi>W. Meaning</hi> as an evidence, ſo nor is there any ſuch perſon in theſe parts, therefore forgery in S. J. to make two where there's but one.</p>
            <p>Then again, whereas G. K. had occaſionally related how S. J. in a Monthly Meeting called one of his fellew Members <hi>Non-ſenſical Puppy,</hi> to wipe off this, he ſays, p. 41. when he met with it in print, he made enquiry, &amp; heard it was ſpoken by one <hi>T. Treſs, an odd ſort of a ſingular man, &amp;c.</hi> But here it may be obſerved, That S. J. is not juſt in this Relation, for it was not only <hi>T. Treſs,</hi> but <hi>R. Ward</hi> alſo, that did then, and do now evidence to the truth thereof. But I ſuppoſe S. J. thought it beſt to mention but one evidence, that the matter related againſt him, might ſeem the more probable to he falſe. So where only <hi>One</hi> Evidence is brought againſt G. K. he'll forge another to make up two, that the charge againſt G. K. may ſeem true, as p. 3. but where <hi>Two</hi> evidences are againſt himſelf, he'll relate only <hi>One</hi> of them, to make the charge ſeem not true, ſee p. 41. Behold, ye Signers of <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> Certificate, this is him ye call your <hi>well-beloved Friend, who was just to all men!</hi> will ye ſay he is juſt in this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related? I ſuppoſe not. Well might he be aſhamed to let his Book go publickly abroad, here in <hi>America,</hi> where ſo many knew it to be made up chiefly of <hi>Lyes, Perverſions</hi> &amp; <hi>Forgeries,</hi> and therefore it was great Policy in him to keep
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41023:13"/> his books up, and not let one of them be ſeen by thoſe that were abuſed therein. But now they are come to hand another way, &amp; his Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine way of ſpreading them is to no purpoſe. And it now lies upon him to vindicate his ſaid book, and make a juſt Reply to G.K's Anſwer to him: Some of the Perſons abuſed by his Book, have demanded a publick Conference, where they offer to detect his Falſhoods; but this I find he evades.</p>
            <p>There is one paſſage more which I cannot well paſs by without detecting the notorious Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thereof, and that is in pag. 24. of <hi>S. J.</hi>'s Book, where he inſinuates, That G.K. grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> his hearers by telling them <hi>of a preaching Quaker in</hi> Maryland, <hi>That got another mans Wife with Child, which they could not diſcern by the Light within: and of another being carried out of a Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe drunk.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more in anſwer to theſe, but that we charge them on S. J. as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Falſhoods, and defie the whole world to make good that ever G. K. uttered ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in his Preaching. And S. J. might be aſhamed to fill his Book with ſuch lying ſtuff. But <hi>T. Elwood</hi> has in great part followed S. J. foot-ſteps, and taken many things upon his credit, elſe ſurely he would not have uttered ſo many Falſhoods and Perverſions, which we think to detect ſhortly.</p>
